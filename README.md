# **Quest Media Projection Plugin for Unity**  

`Quest Media Projection Plugin for Unity` is a Unity plugin for capturing the Meta Quest screen using the MediaProjection API. This plugin provides four main features:  

1. **Capture Screen as Texture2D**: Capture the Meta Quest screen and handle it as a `Texture2D` in Unity.  
2. **Save Screen Captures**: Save the captured screen to storage.

### **ðŸŽ‰ New Passthrough Camera API Now Available ðŸš€**

Meta has recently **introduced** the **Quest Passthrough Camera API**, which allows third-party developers to access the **passthrough camera feed**, a feature that was previously restricted due to privacy concerns.

This new API brings a significant relief, as it means we are finally **free from the restrictions and workarounds** that had to be employed before. No longer will developers need to navigate around limitations to achieve passthrough camera functionality.

As a result, this repository will now be **archived** and preserved for **reference purposes only**. Moving forward, the **official Passthrough Camera API** will be the recommended approach for all passthrough camera development.

## Device Preparation

### 1. **Firmware Version**
Ensure that your Meta Quest device is running **firmware v68 or later**.  
Media Projection functionality was re-enabled starting with **firmware v68**, so earlier versions may not work as expected.

### 2. **App Permissions - Spatial Data**  
Make sure to enable the **Spatial Data** permission for the app to function correctly.  
To do this:
  1. Open **Settings** on your Quest device.
  2. Navigate to **Apps > App Permissions**.
  3. Find your app and ensure **Spatial Data** is enabled.

## Installation

1. **Create a Meta Quest Project**:  
   - If using the **Meta SDK**, refer to the official tutorials:  
     - [Hello World](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-tutorial-hello-vr)  
     - [Passthrough Starter Guide](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-passthrough-gs)  
   - If using **OpenXR**, refer to the OpenXR implementation at:  
     - [QuestMediaProjection-OpenXR](https://github.com/t-34400/QuestMediaProjection-OpenXR)  

2. **Download and Import UnityPackage**:
   - Download the UnityPackage from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/t-34400/QuestMediaProjection/releases) page.
   - Import the `.unitypackage` into your Unity project.

3. **Configure Project Settings**:
   - Go to the menu bar and select `Edit > Project Settings`.
   - In the window that appears, go to the `Player` tab and configure the following:
     - In the `Other Settings` panel, set the `Target API Level` to 34 or higher.
     - In the `Publishing Settings`, check the boxes for `Custom Main Manifest`, `Custom Main Gradle Template`, and `Custom Gradle Properties Template`.

     <img src="Images/player-tab_2.png" width="300" />
     </p>
    
  - If you have enabled `Minify` in the Publishing Settings, you will need to check the `Custom Proguard File` option.

4. **Modify AndroidManifest.xml**:  
   - Open `Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml`.  
   - Add the following permission inside the `<manifest>` tag:  
     ```xml
     <manifest ...>
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
         <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION" />
         ...
     </manifest>
     ```
   - Add the following service definition inside the `<application>` tag:  
     ```xml
     <application ...>
        <service
            android:name="com.t34400.mediaprojectionlib.core.MediaProjectionService"
            android:foregroundServiceType="mediaProjection"
            android:stopWithTask="true"
            android:exported="false" />
        ...
     </application>
     ```
   - **Note:** In **Unity 6+**, you need to **remove the `UnityPlayerActivity` block** from the manifest to avoid conflicts.  
     If your project is using **GameActivity**, keep the `UnityPlayerGameActivity` block and remove the `UnityPlayerActivity` block:  
     ```xml
     <!-- Remove this block if using GameActivity -->
     <activity android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerActivity" ...>
         ...
     </activity>

     <!-- Keep this block if using GameActivity -->
     <activity android:name="com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayerGameActivity" ...>
         ...
     </activity>
     ```

5. **Update gradleTemplate.properties**:
   - Open `Assets/Plugins/Android/gradleTemplate.properties`.
   - Add the following lines:
     ```
     android.useAndroidX=true
     android.enableJetifier=true
     ```

6. **Update mainTemplate.gradle**:
   - Open `Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle`.
   - Add the appropriate dependencies in the `dependencies` scope:
     ```groovy
     dependencies {
        ...
        implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.6.1'
        implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-serialization-json:1.7.2'

     }
     ```

7. **Update proguard-user.txt**:
  - If you have enabled Minify in the Publishing Settings you need to add the following line to the generated `Assets/Plugins/Android/proguard-user.txt` by enabling the `Custom Proguard File` option 
    ```txt
    -keep class com.t34400.mediaprojectionlib.** { *; }
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Add the `ServiceContainer` component and `MediaProjectionViewModel` component to a suitable `GameObject`.
2. In the `MediaProjectionViewModel` component, set the `ServiceContainer` field to the previously added `ServiceContainer` component.
3. Adjust the screen capture frequency using the `Min Update Interval [s]` field.
4. Proceed to configure any of the following features as needed.

</p>

### Capturing Screen as Texture2D

1. In the `MediaProjectionViewModel` component, check the `Texture Required` option.
2. Assign the object that will use the texture to the `Texture Updated` event and select the property/method from the dropdown.
   - If you want to process the texture in a custom component, define a public method like the following, attach it to a `GameObject`, register it with the event, and select the method from the dropdown:
     ```csharp
     using UnityEngine;

     class TextureHandler : MonoBehaviour
     {
         public void ProcessTexture(Texture2D texture)
         {
             // process texture...
         }
     }
     ```
   - If you want to apply the texture to a material, attach the material and select `mainTexture` from the dropdown.


### Saving Captures

1. Add the `ImageSaverViewModel` component to a suitable `GameObject` and attach the `MediaProjectionViewModel` component created in the basic setup to its `MediaProjectionViewModel` field.
2. Specify a filename prefix in the `FilenamePrefix` field.
3. The captured images will be saved to `/sdcard/Android/data/<package name>/files/<FilenamePrefix><timestamp>.jpg`.

</p>

## Note
- **To enable/disable MediaProjection:**  
  Simply set `ServiceContainer.enabled` to `true` or `false`.  
  - **Important Limitation:**  
    - `MediaProjection` does not support a built-in pause/resume feature.  
    - If you disable it, you will need to request user permission again to restart the projection.  
  - **If you only want to pause Unity-side processing** while keeping `MediaProjection` active, set `enabled = false` on the corresponding `ViewModel` instead.
